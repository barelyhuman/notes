being approachable is a really simple but the amount of people who you just can't talk too are way too high. 

One person I know who is super approachable is Dom(that's not the real name, just so that people don't go bursting into the dm's of the real dev), I've approached him with various questions over the past few months that I've had twitter. Stupid ones, obvious ones, one's that I already had the answers to but needed validation, you name it. 

The guy has been cool about everything and based on observation, a lot of the OSS devs are, there might be a few rare ones who are hard to talk to. 

And, due to this nature of his, I don't have to think twice before sending a message or asking a question and the conversation never stops at the answer even though the only thing I can talk about is tech. 

End of the day, it's fun and makes it easier for other devs to get into the community and not worry about asking for help
