Spent a good few hours trying to debug an issue with a docker image I was trying to build , just to realise that it was the fault of the Arm chipset running the docker all along. 

To pin point the issue, I wanted to build an alpine image with android essentials and react native essentials and I couldn't get the SDK to install the `emulator` package because there's no
emulator package for arm64 linux, if only I had checked the arch docker was picking up first.
