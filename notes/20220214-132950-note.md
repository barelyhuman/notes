I feel like I've been moving backwards, github to cgit, js to c lang. 
and oh, I just realised , goblin is the only useful piece of software that's useful
in my entire repo collection which is about 270+ repos on github right now. 

The problem with that? nothing really. 
The blind number that I was proud of 270, is nothing more than that, it's a fake count of things I've created. 

BUT! 

It's nice to know there's at least one that's actually useful and while there's very limited amount of scope that I could scale goblin up to, it might reach "strictly" bug fixes stage soon and then I'll finally have time to spam github.com/new for more such fake projects.

To be honest, most of them were created to make sure I sleep well, cause my brain needs to be tired for me to properly sleep. 

Anyway, I do have a project I want to dedicate my time to next, so I'll be 
picking that up. 

It might be useful, it might not be. I'm going to code it anyways
