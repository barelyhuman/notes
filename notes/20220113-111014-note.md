when working with minio in docker-compose, you'll need to expose the service using nginx and use the same for the app / api that you
going to use the minio

the catch is that you still provide the nginx service the docker internal urls for the proxy but use the exposed port urls
when passing to the api service.

it's confusing but i guess you can figure it out right? "reaper"
