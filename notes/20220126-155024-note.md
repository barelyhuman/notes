OTA updates for react native is a big thing but the fact that there's only codepush and expo that handle it is well a problem. 

The fact that each requires a dependency on a platform to work is something that doesn't fit with me. 

While, expo has been trying to move out of the dependency on their EAS platform it's still the only solution and the other solutions that exist haven't been tested enough or even have a usable example.

There's more research that I did about the topic and you can let me know so I can pass it out for a simpler template that could be setup to help people with the problem
