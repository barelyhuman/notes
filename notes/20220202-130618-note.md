I ended up reaching out to one of devs of Artsy who's built most of their react native app and now I have another resource to refer for a uploaded dynamic bundle, it's a bit more advanced then the simple blogs I found before so I'm going to read and figure it out. It's only for iOS right now which is fine, I'm sure I can implement the same for android in a similar fashion. 

guess, I have to get out the Java reference docs again, I don't remember shit about that language and android development. I'll leave it to my curiosity to solve this. 

Here's the iOS changes for anyone that might want to create their own custom apphub / codepush implementation
