wanted to experiment with pnpm and ended up creating a web version for sizesnap

[https://sizesnap.reaper.im](https://sizesnap.reaper.im)

also, it was easier to setup and deploy compared to npm workspaces, not that it was worspaces fault
but something with regards to the deployment on vercel , it was easier to get pnpm working so I switched, I still have to figure out why npm didn't work
so I will update that here when I do find the reason
