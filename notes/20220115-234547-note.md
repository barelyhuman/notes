well, after a long time, I'm using nextjs for something like this and I kinda enjoy it, I still have all the bash scripts in place to keep me sane and quick at writing these and if there's something you are doing on a unix/linux platform just look for bash scripts for the task, theres a good chance someone has written something similar.

also, I use fish, not bash but does that matter? **nope!**
