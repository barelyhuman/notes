got helped on an open source project today, felt good. 

Though, the fakerjs event makes me think and kinda actually humbles me down that at the highest point, whatever I build is going to be used by me and I won't end up harming a ton of people. 

Earn from open source is definitely a dream though, not all dreams come have to come true, some can just be around to make you feel good about something
