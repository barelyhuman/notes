today, i spent time improving on older tools that I built at a point of time and observed that I never polished them as much as I could have, just built it for functionality and then left it to die while I could've improved them greatly.

I think the attitude I have towards getting it done quickly and being impulsive about tasks is also the reason why I don't have a package / library / tool that a lot of people use. They see that things have been abandoned and I probably won't be there to help them with it.

While that is a valid assumption from their perspective, I generally let the tool go cause I built it for me and I've used it as much as I could but found something better and started using that instead.

If someone else would actually use something I built and came up with issues and feedback, I'd actually pick that thing up and do it, but they wouldn't know that so it's valid from both sides but I guess, I'm going to now focus on just 1 project at once. I'll try to actually, my impulsive nature normally distracts me to something more interesting quite quickly so it's hard but I'll try my best. Let's see if it makes a difference or not.
