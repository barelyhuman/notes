If trying to write a flow with a lot of state changes, or a cli with a lot of data manipulation, make sure the data gathering phase
is done before any manipulation, the side effect of this is that you know exactly where to look for something instead of going through lines
and lines of code to find where you actually fetched the data

this is a general approach that developers know about when working with databases, where

1. You fetch the needed data , all of it, first
2. then manipulate it , if needed

and in the same, the dependent data is fetched by referencing the dependent data and that's it, no manipulation before that
