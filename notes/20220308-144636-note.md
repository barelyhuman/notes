Lately I've started doing a lot of devops related work and most of it has been on the side of mobile development. 

This is primarily with regards to the following topic 
1. Generating Development and Production Builds for React Native 
2. Handling their movement to the respective stores 
3. Working with fastlane  
4. And well, making gitlab ci yaml's a lot more readable and smaller


I could go in detail for each but then that's more a tutorial and you can find most of it online 

Coming back to the thought at hand, it took a while but I realised that most of the taks I ended up doing were done when all hell was let loose and didn't do it when I started the projects. 

Primarily because I wasn't a part of the project when it started but still, no excuses, I could have collected time to do them then, I had the knowledge, I knew what was to be done but I let it pass. 

I wouldn't even call it tech debt but just laziness, I was lazy and this ended up being the reason for a lot of dependency on me as an employee. 

Need ios builds? Contact Reaper 
Have to deploy to prod? Contact Reaper 
Wifi not working? Contact ...

You get the point. 

So, for anyone else who's of the thought right now that "Oh, this can be in a CI but we'll do that later" , please find time for it and complete it now.
