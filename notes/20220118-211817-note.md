**TIL**, that even if you right prototype function in JS , it will not autocomplete if the function definitions aren't directly on the `this` object and that frustates me for some reason. 

Anyway, I guess I'll be writing the TS Types for the package anyway so hopefully the users of the library won't have the same issue
